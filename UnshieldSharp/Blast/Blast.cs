 *
 * blast.c decompresses data compressed by the PKWare Compression Library.
 * This function provides functionality similar to the explode() function of
 * the PKWare library, hence the name "blast".
 *
 * This decompressor is based on the excellent format description provided by
 * Ben Rudiak-Gould in comp.compression on August 13, 2001.  Interestingly, the
 * example Ben provided in the post is incorrect.  The distance 110001 should
 * instead be 111000.  When corrected, the example byte stream becomes:
 *
 *    00 04 82 24 25 8f 80 7f
 *
 * which decompresses to "AIAIAIAIAIAIA" (without the quotes).
 */

/*
 * Change history:
 *
 * 1.0  12 Feb 2003     - First version
 * 1.1  16 Feb 2003     - Fixed distance check for > 4 GB uncompressed data
 * 1.2  24 Oct 2012     - Add note about using binary mode in stdio
 *                      - Fix comparisons of differently signed integers
 * 1.3  24 Aug 2013     - Return unused input from blast()
 *                      - Fix test code to correctly report unused input
 *                      - Enable the provision of initial input to blast()
